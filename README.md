The first attempt to work with the STM32F103C6 microcontroller. In the Proteus 8 environment, a circuit was made from the microcontroller, 3.5V power supply, grounding and a yellow LED. The LED blinks every 500 ms. The microcontroller code is written in the STM32CubeIDE environment, the .hex file should de loadeded into the microcontroller model manualy. Open the STM32.pdsprj file, click on the STM32F103C model, chose the path to the previously downloaded .hex file and run the simulation by the icon in the lower left corner. The hex file is attached separately, as is the project circuit.
