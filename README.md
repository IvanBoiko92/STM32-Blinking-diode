The first attempt to work with the STM32F103C6 microcontroller. In the Proteus 8 environment, a circuit was made from the microcontroller, 3.5V power supply, grounding and a yellow LED. The LED blinks every 500 ms. The microcontroller code is written in the STM32CubeIDE environment, the .hex file is loaded into the microcontroller model. Open the STM32.pdsprj file and run the simulation using the icon in the lower left corner. The hex file is attached separately, as is the project circuit.
